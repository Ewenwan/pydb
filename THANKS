This debugger is an extension of the Python debugger pdb which
did much of the heavy lifting.

The manual also was taken from the Python debugger. But it also draws
on my bashdb debugger reference and both of these at time use some of
the organization and phrases from the GNU Debugger Manual (gdb).

Stuart Frankel, Ph. Mad. did some amazing proof reading and editing of
the manual. (I may have mucked it up some since then though.)

Also thanks to:

Stephen Emslie        - Python Patch 1641544 
Matt Fleming          - Gdb-style signal handling and NetBSD packaging
Oleksandr Moskalenko  - Debian packaging
