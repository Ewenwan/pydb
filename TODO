Remote debugging
add for threading:
   step [count] Thread-name
   next [count] Thread-name

Mock objects for thread id's/names. Then more tests on thread code.

reinstate "thread" command? 

Add watchpoints. (Mentioned in pdbimprovements)

The main pydb.py file size has been reduced but it is still bit
large. If we can break out into more files that might be nice.

Some more regression tests should to be written. They've been
invaluable so far and maintain quality. Especially for the large
changes.

Redo post_mortem, pm, set_step to funnel through parse_options rather
than taking the optional cmdfile and opts parameters.

gdb return command relies on the existence of a return statement in
the code.

Add online debugger concept help and in LaTeX? 

Write Bdb documentation. 

Add in patches of various Bdb's such as the one in Eric.

Better history completion. Better history completion interaction inside
ipython and with or without Emacs.

Eric or Idle integration.

Use inspect module get_stack rather than bdb's?
