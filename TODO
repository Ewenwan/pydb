Many more regression tests need to be written. They expose errors that
are in there and maintain quality. And Some large changes may be in
the works.

A great deal of help has been added, but a great more needs to be
added.  A manual using Python documentation conventions
will has been started. More work is needed.

Add gdb return command. (Pretty straightforward)

To internal debugger help, we will probably get help categories such as
exist in gdb. And the debugger manual will probably follow that.

There seem to be weirdnesses in the debugger that I don't fully
comprehend and I think they exist in pydb.py as well. 

Should check into getting this integrated with ipython's "run -d".  It
has a history mechanism and pydb should too. If it is possible to use
a class form ipython or a class that's out there, that should be done.

The debugger code is growing too large. It needs to be split out.

The examine command needs to deal with arbitrary objects better.

Revise to use inspect module

Use a better readline if that's available.
