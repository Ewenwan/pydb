A great deal of help has been added, but a great more needs to be
added.  Probably a full manual using Python documentation conventions
will be done.

To internal debugger help, we will probably get help categories such as
exist in gdb. And the debugger manual will probably follow that.

Switching help between gdb and python doesn't update the help list or
commands. 

There seem to be weirdnesses in the debugger that I don't fully
comprehend and I think they exist in pydb.py as well. 

Should check into getting this integrated with ipython's "run -d".  It
has a history mechanism and pydb should too. If it is possible to use
a class form ipython or a class that's out there, that should be done.

The debugger code is growing too large. It needs to be split out.

The examine command needs to deal with arbitrary objects better.
