The debugger code is growing too large. It needs to be split out.
The current thought is to split out the customization code of 
cmd and bdb into their own modules/classes. 

Also installation should to into a pydb directory. Need to figure out
how to get autotools to do this.

Some more regression tests should to be written. They've been
invaluable so far and maintain quality. Especially for large changes.
in the works.

gdb return command relies on the existance of a return statement in
the code.

Add online debugger concept help and in LaTeX? 

There seem to be weirdnesses in the debugger that I don't fully
comprehend and I think they exist in pydb.py as well.

Should check into getting this integrated with ipython's "run -d".  It
has a history mechanism and pydb should too. If it is possible to use
a class form ipython or a class that's out there, that should be done.

The examine command needs to deal with arbitrary objects better.

Use a better readline if that's available.

Use inspect module get_stack rather than bdb's?
