.SH AUTHOR
pydb was written by Richard Wolff <rwolff@noao.edu> (now retired)
based on the standard Python debugger pdb.py. In the years pdb.py and
pydb.py have diverged. It was subsequently revised and
expanded to be more like gdb by Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

This manual page was written by Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>
for the Debian project (but may be used by others).
