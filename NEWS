*  Line tracing now shows source text.
*  Document how to turn on and off from program control
*  Remove pdb backwards-compatibile runctx. This is a new debugger.
*  list command can accept filename:lineo (if that's all that's given)
*  Doc fixes for "source" command

1.15

* Add gdb history commands:
    set history ..., show history ..., show commands

* Add command completion (gdb: complete)

* Add log redirection (gdb: set logging, show logging)

* Add gdb directory commands: cd, pwd

* Add --cd invocation option 

* Add installation section in documentation

* reorder documentation so important stuff is towards the
  front. Small text corrections too.

* Add pyreadline as a configuration option.  

* Position location in file in GNU Emacs tracking in when in 
  comint shell: pydbtrack is a modified pdbtrack for Pydb. 

* Some single-letter command names for these reasons
  1. We now have command completion (often)
  2. If the letter isn't a command it can be used as a variable name
     in an assignment
  3. There is an alias mechanism that can be used
  4. Some of the commands like "j" for "jump" aren't used that much;
     or in the case of "cont" for "continue", there already was an 
     abbreviation "c". 
  5. Multiple names makes help and completion more awkward.

* Fix bugs in configuration management. Make distcheck works again
  (sometimes)

1.13
2006-02-27

* Add MAN page (from Debian)
* Bump revision to 0.12 to 1.13 to be compatible with Debian pydb package.
* Improve set_trace(), post_mortem(), and pm()
* Document alternative invocation methods and how to call from a program.
* Break out cmds and bdb overrides into a separate module
* add optional count on "where"
* install in our own directory (e.g. site-packages/pydb)
  NOTE: REMOVE OLD PYDB INSTALLATIONS BEFORE INSTALLING THIS PYDB.
* As a result of the above add __init__.py to give package info.
* Don't rely on tabs settings. Remove all tabs in programs and use -t 
  to check that.
* Various bug fixes and documentation corrections

* Add gdb commands: 
    - "cd" command
    - "display", "undisplay"
    - help subcommands for "show", "info", and "set"
    - info: "display", "line" "source" and "program"
    - "pwd" command
    - "return" (early exit from a function)
    - "shell" command
    - Extend "info line" to allow a function name.

* Use inspect module. Argument parameters and values are now shown.

* Break out debugger into more files 

* File location reporting changed. Is now like mdb, bashdb, or (or perldb)

* Changes to make more compatible with ddd.

* Doc fixes, add more GNU Emacs debugger commands

* "clear" command now accepts a function name

* Bugfixes:
  - allow debugged program to mangle sys.argv (we save our own copy)

0.11
2006-01-29

* Add regression tests! As a result more of the debugger has been
  tested and a number of bugs in pdb.py have been found and fixed.

* Add line tracing. Allow a delay in linetracing:
   "set linetrace delay *float*" (delay is useful in front-end GUIs)

* Add debugger command options:
    --batch        - don't run interactive commands on shell stops
    --trace (-x)   - non-interactive line tracing a la POSIX shells
    --output (-o)  - redirect stdout to a file 
    --error        - redirect stderr to a file
    --command      - run a debugger command script

* New debugger commands:
   disassemble          - disassemble python instructions
   source               - run a debugger script
   set basename         - show long/short filenames
   set linetrace        - line tracing
   set linetrace delay  - see above
   set cmdtrace         - show debugger script commands before running

* step/next can now take a count. E.g. step 2 or next 3.

* Show more accurate and useful location when we are stopped on an exec.

* Stack trace now reports exec positions a little bit better - 
  it doesn't call it a file.

* Emacs interface (pydb.el) updated for expanded commands

* set prompt allows embedded blanks and punctiation. Still have problems
  with trailing blanks.

* show with no parameters is like gdb: shows all subcommands.

* Class name back to Pdb to make interaction with other programs like 
  ipython more transparent. The *module* name is Pydb, so one must either
  "import pydb" or import "pdb" (stock debugger).

* Error message output made more uniform

* output routines can be subclassed

* Bugfixes:
  - __file__ is set before debugging script. (Bug in 2.4.2 pdb.py)

0.10
2006-01-12

First release of extended python debugger.

* Add gdb frame command

* Add gdb run (restart) command

* Add some "set"/"show" commands:
    args, listsize, version (no set here), dialect

* up/down can take a number of frames to move.

* Stepping skips over "def" statements.

* Document retval

* Add info commands ("args", "break", "line', "locals" and "source")

* Add examine command analogous to Perl's.

* up/down work like gdb's (when gdb dialect is in effect).
  Can supply an optional number of frames to go up/down.

* step/next skip over "def" commands.
