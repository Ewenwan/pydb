This is an expanded version of the Python debugger, pdb.py

Largely we're trying to follow gdb's command set unless there's good
reason. So new or modified command names generally refer to the
function they have in gdb.

Changes from pdb.py:

- Add run (restart)

- Add Perl's "examine" to show info about a symbol.  For functions,
  methods, classes and modules the documentation string if any is printed.
  For functions, we also show the argument list. More work is needed here
  to recurse fields of an arbitrary object and show that.

- add gdb's "frame" command

- Add some "set"/"show" commands:
    args, listsize, version (no set here), dialect

- Add some "info" commands:
   args break, line, locals, source

- up/down can take a number of frames to move.

-  Stepping skips over "def" statements.

Coexistence: 
  For now, we try not to conflict with pdb.py. After all, Python 
  developers made provision of multiple debuggers so we'll make use of
  that!

  So whereever there was a pdb, use pydb. Where Pdb use Pydb. So, as
  hinted above, the debugger initialization script is .pydbrc for this
  debugger rather than .pdbrc for the one that comes with Python.
