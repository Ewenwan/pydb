The Python community or whoever wrote pdb.py is largely responsible
for this.

Richard Wolff (now retired) worked on the pydb.py that is in ddd. I
get the impression he also worked a little on pdb.py. 

The command interface is from GDB, and so much of the error messages
and some parts of the documentation too.

Coordination for putting this together are by Rocky Bernstein.
